# 🥤 kele.el (Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs)

![](./img/kele.jpg)

Kele (*kě lè*, or *kə-ˈlə*) ("Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs")
streamlines integration between Kubernetes and Emacs. It provides a "base layer"
that can be leveraged to build higher-level integrations, e.g. modeline modules
and interactive clients such as
[kubernetes-el](https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el).

Kele comes with "batteries included." It contains several
[integrations](./how-tos/integrations.md) with noteworthy packages that you can
take advantage of in your own configs. These also serve to demonstrate Keles's
capabilities.

!!! note

    Kele is not an official Kubernetes project.
