## Upcoming

This initial release of Kele has a very simple goal: "[`kubectx` and
`kubens`][1], but make it Emacs." Its feature set is limited but lays the
foundation -- both in terms of implementation and "design philosophy" -- for
future enhancements.

## Added

- Added ability to switch and rename contexts, with completion and caching
- Added ability to switch namespaces for any given context
