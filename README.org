#+TITLE: 🥤 kele.el (Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs)

[[file:docs/img/kele.jpg]]

Kele (/kě lè/, or /kə-ˈlə/) ("Kubernetes Enablement Layer for Emacs")
streamlines integration between Kubernetes and Emacs. It provides a "base layer"
that can be leveraged to build higher-level integrations, e.g. modeline modules
and interactive clients such as [[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el][kubernetes-el]].

Kele comes with "batteries included." It contains several integrations with
noteworthy packages that you can take advantage of in your own configs. These
also serve to demonstrate Kele's capabilities. Our documentation includes
tutorials for replicating these integrations yourselves.
